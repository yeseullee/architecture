1. Building/Running your simulator code

   Following are the commands to build and run the code:

   > make       // build code
   > make run   // run code

   The result of running the code will be a 'trace.vcd' waveform
   file. You can view it using 'gtkwave' or 'dinotrace' by tunneling
   X11 through ssh, or you can download the file to your local machine
   and view it there.

   To change the program binary which you are decoding, edit the
   following line in Makefile:
   
   RUNELF=...


2. Viewing the trace.vcd waveform

   If you have logged in to the server using the -Y or -X option, you
   can view waveforms using the following command:

   > gtkwave trace.vcd

   (you can also use dinotrace, or download the .vcd to view it)


3. Submitting your code
   
   Type the following command in your project directory. It will sign
   and submit your code to us:

  > make submit
